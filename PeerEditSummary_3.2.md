## Summary

Provide a summary of the positive and negative aspects of the proposal draft you have reviewed. Specify any places in the reviewed proposal where you did not understand the point, or needed more information, or where something did not seem to belong in the proposal. You have to write at least five sentences in this paragraph.

The proposal is unique and the author appears passionate about the topic. Additionally, they the author appears to have a good understanding of the background of his topic. The method of approach could be explained a little better. From what I'm getting, in this proposal you're going to map a bunch of songs based on the sentiment in the words, but what is this going to show and how will we know your method is correct? Also is there a reason they're becoming more sad. This topic is a very good start and needs to be fleshed out more in almost all the methods. Although, you hit many checkpoints, some were just barely checked.
